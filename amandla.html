                       <img src="images/amoh.jpg">
                       <p> Years after surviving a childhood tragedy, two brothers fall on 
                           opposing sides of the law as a gang-linked crime tests their loyalty to one another.
                           Amandla was a phenomenal addition to Netflix's huge arena of crime thrillers in January 2022. It is based on the devastating story of two brothers who were bound by blood, even when divided by fate.

Written and directed by the acclaimed Nerina De Jager
. The movie is a heart-wrenching depiction of the exploitation of the deprived in South Africa, 
and the reality of its struggle is haunting.
